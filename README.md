## [21Lane](https://github.com/himanshub16/21lane/)

A simple, peer-to-peer file sharing solution.
For v1, consider branch v1, or go to the releases section.

## What can I do with this ?
* Share some folder on your system, which is accessible to other peers on LAN / Internet, who can connect to your IP address.
* Download from other peers using the same service.

## What if I don't want to share to other peers ? Any use in that case ?
You can leave the `Exchange URL` field blank, and share personally with the people you want, using the addresses below.

## Are there any requirements ?
No. You'll get a binary which can be directly executed on your system.

If you are a developer, trying to tinker with it, just install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` file.


## How to contribute to it ?
`
    git clone https://github.com/himanshub16/21lane.git 
    cd 21lane 
    source myftp/bin/activate 
    pip install -r requirements.txt 

`
You are all set.
