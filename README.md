## [21Lane](https://github.com/himanshub16/21lane/)

A simple, peer-to-peer file sharing solution.
For old version, consider [branch v1](https://github.com/himanshub16/21lane/tree/v1), or find older releases [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7BS3b01XjwCOTlPYk00UE1IQ3c).

## What can I do with this ?
* Share some folder on your system, to be available to other peers.
* Download from other peers using the same service.

## What if I don't want to share to other peers ? Any use in that case ?
* Leave the **Exchange URL** field empty, and start sharing.
* You have the link. Copy that link and use it the way you want.

## Are there any requirements ?
No. You'll get a binary which can be directly executed on your system.

If you are a developer, trying to tinker with it, just install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` file.


## How to contribute to it ?
```
git clone https://github.com/himanshub16/21lane.git 
cd 21lane 
source myftp/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
You are all set.
